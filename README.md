Simple demo project for explaining the implementation of Retrofit2 with Moshi converter and Coroutines in Kotlin.

The dependency injection is done with Dagger2. The project is using the repository pattern with use-cases and LiveData.
The images are displayed with Glide 4.8.0.
The project is using the TMDB api for fetching the data, so you will have to add your own tmdb api key in the AppModule.
